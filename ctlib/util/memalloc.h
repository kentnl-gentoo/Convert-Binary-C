/**
 *  \file memalloc.h
 *  \brief Memory allocation and tracing routines
 *
 *  The functions in this file provide an interface to
 *  the standard malloc / free functions, but in addition
 *  you can selectively enable tracing of your memory
 *  allocation. This may be useful to detect memory leaks
 *  or usage of already freed memory blocks.
 *
 *  A Perl script is supplied to analyze the output of
 *  the memory tracing routines.
 *
 *  To enable the tracing capability, the library must be
 *  compiled with the #DEBUG_MEMALLOC preprocessor flag. Then,
 *  you can selectively enable the tracing for each file or
 *  project by using the SetDebugMemAlloc() routine.
 *
 *  The following code shows an example:
 *
 *  \include Alloc.c
 *
 *  Then, a file like this will be written to stdout:
 *
 *  \verbinclude mem_debug.dat
 *
 *  This output is easy to understand. It tells you that
 *
 *  -# in file \c Alloc.c, line 9, there were 16 bytes allocated at address 0x400031C0,
 *  -# in file \c Alloc.c, line 10, address 0x400031C0 was verified,
 *  -# in file \c Alloc.c, line 11, the memory block at address 0x400031C0 was freed,
 *  -# in file \c Alloc.c, line 12, address 0x400031C0 was verified again.
 *
 *  These files usually become very large if you work a lot with
 *  dynamic memory allocation. So it would be rather hard to step
 *  through that file on your own. For that reason, there's a Perl
 *  script called \c check_alloc.pl that will take \c mem_debug.dat
 *  as input and print all errors discovered and summary statistics:
 *
 *  \verbinclude mem_debug.out
 *
 *  As you can see, the last call to AssertValidPtr() caused an error
 *  because the block that was checked has already been freed. The
 *  other output is only useful if you have lots of dynamic memory
 *  allocation, for example:
 *
 *  \verbinclude memdb_large.out
 *
 *  This will tell you that a total of 32404 memory blocks have been
 *  successfully allocated and freed, a maximum of 13305 memory blocks
 *  were in use simultanously, the peak memory usage was 183675 bytes,
 *  the smallest and largest block that were allocated were 2 and 29
 *  bytes in size, respectively, and there were no memory leaks detected.
 *

 *
 *  On the plus side, you get run-time memory allocation tracing,
 *  assertion checking, leak detection and memory statistics.
 *  You can control the amount of statistics by setting the
 *  MEMALLOC_STAT_LEVEL environment variable to a value between
 *  0 and 3, with increasing amount of output.
 *
 *  If an assertion fails, the program will usually abort.
 *  You can choose not to abort the program by setting
 *  MEMALLOC_SOFT_ASSERT to a non-zero value in your
 *  environment.
 *
 *  If you want the memory allocator to keep information about
 *  freed blocks, set MEMALLOC_CHECK_FREED to a non-zero value.
 *  This can give more detailed trace output at the cost of
 *  slower execution.
 *
 *  If you like to see hex dumps of non-freed memory blocks,
